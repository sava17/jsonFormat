# 0016 - Common input/output standard for time-series services
## Motivation
If we decide to have the input and output of our time-series services be of the same format, then that will allow for the possibility to pass the same data between the services.  
A concrete example would be that a data-set can be checked for outliers, and then afterward prediction can be done on the dataset with this in mind on a different service.

## The objective
To create a format allowing for both multiple- and single graphs following the same format, while having a description of each graph + the data-set as a whole. 

## The format
The proposed format is using JSON objects of the following format:
- Name of the dataset *(String)*
- All graphs *(Array of objects)*
    - Graph object(s):
        - Label/name of graph *(String)*
        - Data for graph *(Array of objects)*
            - Data-point object(s):
                - x *(number)*
                - y *(number)*

If desired then each "Data-point object" can be expanded with more data. Having an x- and y-value is, however, mandatory. 
A JSON object following this standard would look like this:
```json
{
  "dataSetName": "Name of dataset",
  "graphs": [
    {
      "label": "Name of graph",
      "data": [
        {
          "x": 2,
          "y": 38,
        },
        {
          "x": 2,
          "y": 38,
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "label": "Name of graph",
      "data": [
        {
          "x": 5,
          "y": 33,
        },
        {
          "x": 42,
          "y": 83,
        },
        {
          "x": 56,
          "y": 153,
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
It is also possible to add aditional data to a "Data-point object" for example:
```json
{
  "x": 2,
  "y": 38,
  "outlier": true
}
```

## Integration with front end UI
If this is approved, then group SW602F20 will implement functionality in the frontend, to convert from the proposed data standard into a data standard which can be represented visually using a framework like Chart.js.
